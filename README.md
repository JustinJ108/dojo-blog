# Dojo Blog

Dojo Blog is a simple blogging platform built with React.
It allows users to browse, create, and delete blog posts in a clean, modern interface.
The project was originally developed as a learning exercise in React fundamentals — covering components, hooks, routing, and REST API interactions.
For data persistence, a JSON server acts as a mock backend API, making it easy to test CRUD operations without a full database setup.
